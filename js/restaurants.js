The Copper Onion serves a wide array of vegetable side dishes and a menu designed to explore and share, with plates such as Ricotta Dumplings with lemon, sage and brown butter and Braised Pork Belly with shaved brussels sprouts and pickled celeriac. Entrees include fresh house-made pastas, fresh fish, and The Copper Onion Burger. An insistent focus on the freshest and best is paramount; sausages and burgers are ground daily, bread is baked and ice cream is made in house, offering casual diners an exceptional experience at affordable prices.",

Although it’s never been our intent to be the biggest brewery in the West, with more than 75 gold, silver and bronze medals; there’s no doubt we’re one of the best.Red Rock Brewing Co. is just blocks away from all downtown hotels and the Salt Palace Convention Center. We’re the perfect stop for a business lunch, afternoon break, or a casual dinner with friends. Red Rock Brewing is family friendly and has a menu to suit every taste. Solo diners are always welcome!We have a diverse selection of craft beer on tap as well as six different high-gravity beers such as our top-selling Double IPA (8.5% ABV); Russian Imperial Stout (10.1% ABV); and our special Anniversary Imperial Red Ale (9.5% ABV)…all served in our big German style 500ml bottles.Come on by and see why the locals love Red Rock!",
